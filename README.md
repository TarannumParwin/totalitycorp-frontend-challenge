 React JS: I used React JS as the front-end library to build the user interface and manage the application's state. React's component-based architecture and virtual DOM make it efficient for creating dynamic and interactive UIs.

JavaScript (ES6+): JavaScript is the primary programming language for building dynamic web applications. ES6+ features offer modern syntax and powerful functionalities that enhance code readability and maintainability.

CSS: I used CSS for styling the user interface of the application. CSS is essential for creating visually appealing and responsive designs.


useState Hook: I used the useState hook from React to manage the state of the application. It allowed me to maintain and update state without using class components.

Components: I organized the application into modular components to promote reusability, readability, and maintainability. Each component has a specific responsibility, making it easier to manage and update.

Props: I used props to pass data and functions between parent and child components. This allowed me to create a clear flow of data and actions within the application.

Functional Programming: Functional programming principles were applied throughout the codebase, which promotes cleaner code, immutability, and easier testing.

Version Control (Git): I used Git for version control, allowing me to track changes to the codebase, collaborate with others, and manage the project's history.

GitHub: GitHub was used as a remote repository to store and share the project's source code. It also provides collaboration features and issue tracking.

Responsive Design: While not explicitly mentioned, I followed responsive design principles to ensure the application works well on different screen sizes and devices.
